											Scope of the processing of personal data <br />
											As a matter of principle, we only collect and use the personal data of our users as much as is necessary to provide a
											functional website as well as our contents and services. The collecting and use of the personal data of our users regularly
											takes place only on a legal basis. An exception applies in such cases in which a legal basis is not apparent and the
											processing of the data can only be authorized via a consent.
										</li>
										<li class="list__item _icon-check">
											Legal basis for the processing of personal data <br />
											Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject to process his or her personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR
											serves as legal basis. Is the processing of personal data required to fulfil a contract whose contracting party is the data
											subject, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b of the GDPR serves as legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are
											necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures and actions. Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary in order
											to fulfill a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para 1 lit. c of the GDPR serves as legal basis. If the
											processing of data is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our Company or of a third party, and if the interests,
											fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 para. 1
											lit. f of the GDPR serves as legal basis for the processing.
										</li>
										<li class="list__item _icon-check">
											Data erasure and storage period <br />
											The personal data of the data subject will be erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of storing the data ceases to apply.
											Furthermore, data may be stored if doing so has been provided for by European or national lawmakers in EU regulations, laws or
											other provisions to which the controller is subject. The data will likewise be blocked or erased if a storage period
											stipulated by the aforementioned rules expires, unless it is necessary to continue storing the data in order to conclude or
											fulfil a contract.

											The legal basis for the temporary storage of data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR. <br />
											The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. As
											relates to the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.
											The collection of data for the provision of the website as well as the storage of data in log files is absolutely necessary
